# Instructions:
1. Select any champion you want to configure
2. Configure it and press "save", Rammus will show you that everything is OK
3. The next time you enter to a game with that champion, their preferences will be loaded

# Aclarations and features: 
- Picking a champion in the game will switch the champion selected in the application
- You have until the match begins to change your preferences, if you are already in the rift... then its late
- Champions without any preference stored will set the skills on the 4 default buttons
- The application doesnt auto-switch to the previous keybinding on match end 

# Known issues:
- You need to have the proper permissions on the installation folder or the save will fail
- You need internet connection
- Aatrox shows with a Q configuration until you configure it, this is only a visual bug, he dont really have anything saved unless you save something on him
