Save your skill preferences for every champion, they will be applied on your game before the match start!

Instructions:
-Select any champion you want to configure
-Configure it and press "save", Rammus will show you that everything is OK
-The next time you enter to a game with that champion, their preferences will be loaded

Aclarations, features, and known issues:
-Picking a champion in the game will switch the champion selected in the application
-You have until the match begins to change your preferences, if you are already in the rift... then its late
-Champions without any preference stored will set the skills on the 4 default buttons
-The application doesnt auto-switch to the previous keybinding on match end 

-You need to have the proper permissions on the installation folder or the save will fail
-You need internet connection
-Aatrox shows with a Q configuration until you configure it, this is only a visual bug, he dont really have anything saved unless you save something on him
